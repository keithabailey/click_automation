# Click Automation in R and Selenium

For many of us, getting meaningful data for our analyses is one of the more difficult parts of our jobs and one that does not always appear automatable. As someone who strives to elevate myself and my teams away from the production of data sets, this is particularly frustrating. Luckily, many companies provide APIs to make it easier to fetch the data you need and there are great tools such as Galvanize Robots that makes it even easier to do this, with connectors for a wide variety of systems, both cloud and on premise.

Sadly, this is not the case with all providers and so we are left to our manual efforts to fetch what we need, especially when the provider generates downloadable reports. Using three tools we can automate away the entire data-fetch process. Fair warning, there is some setup required first, but its worth it. Be careful which sites you scrape (don&#39;t hammer small guys sites for example), review their fair use policies and be a good citizen.
